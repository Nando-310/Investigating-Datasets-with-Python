# Investigating-Datasets-with-Python
Investigate appointment data to determine factors that affect attendance
In this project I will use python to investigate data from a clinic to determine what factors play a role in attendance.
Specifically we will investigate gender and age and use bar charts and other visulization tools to understand our data.
Before we can investigate our data, we must clean the data making sure to remove any null values and duplicate entries.
I also made use of functions to reduce repetitive code.
From my analysis I found that Gender had no affect on patient attendance. Upon further examination it is clear that age was a big factor in attendance of patients. patients between the age of 0-10 had the best attendance record. You can see as group of patient gets older the more attendance starts to drop.
